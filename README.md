# Item Application On Linux Web Server

## Description
The goals from the Udacity program state that:
```
You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.
```
The application referred to is our item catalog app, which we created [here](https://github.com/hackinhukk/ItemCatalogUDC/tree/master/app)
